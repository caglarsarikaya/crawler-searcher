# crawler-searcher
 it is a basic web crawler and indexer app. I create this before graduate from university
 
 
 the application has 2 different sides. One for crawling, other for searching.
 
 you will give a seed page for starts the crawl process.
 
 it will read all html tags related with links, and store them.
 Thread units will start from this list to crawl, it will also add new links,
 
 
 second side is just for searching from your indexes. I used meta description tag and site titles for indexing pages, if it matches with your search word, by the way would be better if I add a search ranking algorithm
